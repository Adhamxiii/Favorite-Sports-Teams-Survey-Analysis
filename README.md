## Project Goals

The primary goals of the survey were:

1. **Collect Data:** Gather information about participants' favorite sports teams across different sports.
2. **Analyze Preferences:** Analyze the collected data to identify the most popular sports and teams among the participants.
3. **Visualize Insights:** Create visualizations to represent the distribution of preferences.

## Methodology

The survey was conducted using an online survey platform and distributed among college students. Participants were asked to indicate their favorite sports teams in various categories, including football, basketball, baseball, and others. The survey also included demographic questions such as age, gender, and sports interests.

## Data Collection

- **Participants:** A total of 130 college students participated in the survey.
- **Demographics:** Participants were from diverse backgrounds, with varying ages and genders.
- **Sports Categories:** Participants were asked to provide their favorite teams in each of the specified sports categories.

## Data Analysis

The collected data was analyzed using descriptive statistics and data visualization techniques. The analysis included the following steps:

1. **Time to Complete Analysis:** Calculating the average time taken to complete the survey.
2. **Demographic Analysis:** Analyzing demographic factors such as age, gender, and education.
3. **Favorite Teams Analysis:** Identifying the most favored sports teams and their distribution.
4. **Correlation Analysis:** Exploring correlations between variables, such as age and frequency of watching games, importance of winning, motivation to support the team, etc.
5. **Chi-Square Tests:** Conducting chi-square tests to examine relationships between categorical variables.
6. **Visualization:** Creating various types of visualizations, including pie charts, bar charts, and stacked bar charts.

## Key Findings

1. **Popular Teams:** The survey revealed that "Al Ahly" and "Zamalek" were among the most favored sports teams.
2. **Demographic Patterns:** Gender and age were found to have significant associations with preferences and behaviors related to sports teams.
3. **Correlations:** Several interesting correlations were found between variables such as age, frequency of watching games, importance of winning, motivation to support the team, and feeling when losing.
